# Lab 2

**Due:** Monday September 21, 10am

## Problem

Every country has a change in population over time (up or down) due to three causes: births, deaths, and migration. Write a program that estimates future population size for a country (any country) given its rate of births, deaths, and migration, the current population, and the desired number of years in the future for the estimate. For example, if the user enters 1 birth every 8 seconds, 1 death every 12 seconds, 1 immigrant every 28 seconds, a current population of 326,766,748 (estimates from the US Census) and wants to estimate the population 5 years into the future, the program should respond with an estimate of 338,968,177. **Note:** to specify net emmigration, use a negative number for migration. 

## Instructions

1. Create **test cases** (see section below). 
2.	Create a new Python file and include **intro comments** at the top of your .py file (template below). Include both of your names in the file name.
3. **Use comments to write the algorithm** your program will follow.
4.	Write the Python **code** corresponding to each of your algorithm's steps.
5.	**Test** your completed code using your test cases. If the output doesn't match, correct your program.
6.	**Commit** and **push** changes and check github.com to confirm the update before leaving lab (even if not finished).

### Test Cases

Create an Excel File with at least five test cases. Use one row per test case with a column for test number, a column for each input, followed by a column for each corresponding output. Use a calculator if needed to compute the outputs. **Use the example in the problem statement as your first test case.**

## Submission
