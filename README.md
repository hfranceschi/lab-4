Lab 4
Due: Tuesday September 22 (11PM)

You need to write two classes:
**Name1Name2Rectangle and Name1Name2RectangleClient (for me, it would be HerveFranceschiRectangle and HerveFranceschiRectangleClient)**

The Name1Name2Rectangle class encapsulates a rectangle:

A rectangle has a width and a height, both integers. **Both width and height must be greater than or equal to 0 at all times**. It includes the following methods:
A default constructor that sets the values of width and height to 0.
A constructor that accepts two parameters and assigns them to the width and height.
Two accessor methods for width and height.
Two mutator methods for width and height.
A method to calculate **and return** the perimeter of the ("this") rectangle (i.e. NOT another rectangle).
A method to calculate **and return** the area of the ("this") rectangle (i.e. NOT another rectangle).
A toString method (use common sense to decide what String it should return). The toString methods returns a "human readable" representation of the ("this") object.

The rectangle client class, where the main method is located, must **test ALL the methods** of the rectangle class above; at the very minimum, it should call both constructors and the seven other methods above.
